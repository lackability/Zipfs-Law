First Lieutenant Jimmy Cross carried letters from a girl named
Martha, a junior at Mount Sebastian College in New Jersey. They were
not love letters, but Lieutenant Cross was hoping, so he kept them folded
in plastic at the bottom of his rucksack. In the late afternoon, after a
day's march, he would dig his foxhole, wash his hands under a canteen,
unwrap the letters, hold them with the tips of his fingers, and spend the
last hour of light pretending. He would imagine romantic camping trips
into the White Mountains in New Hampshire. He would sometimes taste
the envelope flaps, knowing her tongue had been there. More than
anything, he wanted Martha to love him as he loved her, but the letters
were mostly chatty, elusive on the matter of love. She was a virgin, he
was almost sure. She was an English major at Mount Sebastian, and she
wrote beautifully about her professors and roommates and midterm
exams, about her respect for Chaucer and her great affection for Virginia
Woolf. She often quoted lines of poetry; she never mentioned the war,
except to say, Jimmy, take care of yourself. The letters weighed 10
ounces. They were signed Love, Martha, but Lieutenant Cross
understood that Love was only a way of signing and did not mean what
he sometimes pretended it meant. At dusk, he would carefully return the
letters to his rucksack. Slowly, a bit distracted, he would get up and move
among his men, checking the perimeter, then at full dark he would
return to his hole and watch the night and wonder if Martha was a virgin.

The things they carried were largely determined by necessity. Among
the necessities or near-necessities were P-38 can openers, pocket knives,
heat tabs, wristwatches, dog tags, mosquito repellent, chewing gum,
candy, cigarettes, salt tablets, packets of Kool-Aid, lighters, matches,
sewing kits, Military Payment Certificates, C rations, and two or three
canteens of water. Together, these items weighed between 15 and 20
pounds, depending upon a man's habits or rate of metabolism. Henry
Dobbins, who was a big man, carried extra rations; he was especially
fond of canned peaches in heavy syrup over pound cake. Dave Jensen,
who practiced field hygiene, carried a toothbrush, dental floss, and
several hotel-sized bars of soap he'd stolen on R&R in Sydney, Australia.
Ted Lavender, who was scared, carried tranquilizers until he was shot in
the head outside the village of Than Khe in mid-April. By necessity, and
because it was SOP, they all carried steel helmets that weighed 5 pounds
including the liner and camouflage cover. They carried the standard
fatigue jackets and trousers. Very few carried underwear. On their feet
they carried jungle boots—2.1 pounds—and Dave Jensen carried three
pairs of socks and a can of Dr. Scholl's foot powder as a precaution
against trench foot. Until he was shot, Ted Lavender carried 6 or 7
ounces of premium dope, which for him was a necessity. Mitchell
Sanders, the RTO, carried condoms. Norman Bowker carried a diary. Rat
Kiley carried comic books. Kiowa, a devout Baptist, carried an illustrated
New Testament that had been presented to him by his father, who taught
Sunday school in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. As a hedge against bad
times, however, Kiowa also carried his grandmother's distrust of the
white man, his grandfather's old hunting hatchet. Necessity dictated.
Because the land was mined and booby-trapped, it was SOP for each
man to carry a steel-centered, nylon-covered flak jacket, which weighed
6.7 pounds, but which on hot days seemed much heavier. Because you
could die so quickly, each man carried at least one large compress
bandage, usually in the helmet band for easy access. Because the nights
were cold, and because the monsoons were wet, each carried a green
plastic poncho that could be used as a raincoat or groundsheet or
makeshift tent. With its quilted liner, the poncho weighed almost 2
pounds, but it was worth every ounce. In April, for instance, when Ted
Lavender was shot, they used his poncho to wrap him up, then to carry
him across the paddy, then to lift him into the chopper that took him
away.

They were called legs or grunts.
To carry something was to hump it, as when Lieutenant Jimmy Cross
humped his love for Martha up the hills and through the swamps. In its
intransitive form, to hump meant to walk, or to march, but it implied
burdens far beyond the intransitive.
Almost everyone humped photographs. In his wallet, Lieutenant Cross
carried two photographs of Martha. The first was a Kodacolor snapshot
signed Love, though he knew better. She stood against a brick wall. Her
eyes were gray and neutral, her lips slightly open as she stared straighton at the camera. At night, sometimes, Lieutenant Cross wondered who
had taken the picture, because he knew she had boyfriends, because he
loved her so much, and because he could see the shadow of the picturetaker spreading out against the brick wall. The second photograph had
been clipped from the 1968 Mount Sebastian yearbook. It was an action
shot—women's volleyball—and Martha was bent horizontal to the floor,
reaching, the palms of her hands in sharp focus, the tongue taut, the
expression frank and competitive. There was no visible sweat. She wore
white gym shorts. Her legs, he thought, were almost certainly the legs of
a virgin, dry and without hair, the left knee cocked and carrying her
entire weight, which was just over 100 pounds. Lieutenant Cross
remembered touching that left knee. A dark theater, he remembered,
and the movie was Bonnie and Clyde, and Martha wore a tweed skirt,
and during the final scene, when he touched her knee, she turned and
looked at him in a sad, sober way that made him pull his hand back, but
he would always remember the feel of the tweed skirt and the knee
beneath it and the sound of the gunfire that killed Bonnie and Clyde, how
embarrassing it was, how slow and oppressive. He remembered kissing
her good night at the dorm door. Right then, he thought, he should've
done something brave. He should've carried her up the stairs to her room
and tied her to the bed and touched that left knee all night long. He
should've risked it. Whenever he looked at the photographs, he thought
of new things he should've done.
What they carried was partly a function of rank, partly of field
specialty.
As a first lieutenant and platoon leader, Jimmy Cross carried a
compass, maps, code books, binoculars, and a .45-caliber pistol that
Christine Taylor Riendeau Thursday, February 16, 2012 11:56:25 AM ET
weighed 2.9 pounds fully loaded. He carried a strobe light and the
responsibility for the lives of his men.
As an RTO, Mitchell Sanders carried the PRC-25 radio, a killer, 26
pounds with its battery.
As a medic, Rat Kiley carried a canvas satchel filled with morphine and
plasma and malaria tablets and surgical tape and comic books and all the
things a medic must carry, including M&M's for especially bad wounds,
for a total weight of nearly 20 pounds.
As a big man, therefore a machine gunner, Henry Dobbins carried the
M-60, which weighed 23 pounds unloaded, but which was almost always
loaded. In addition, Dobbins carried between 10 and 15 pounds of
ammunition draped in belts across his chest and shoulders.
As PFCs or Spec 4s, most of them were common grunts and carried
the standard M-16 gas-operated assault rifle. The weapon weighed 7.5
pounds unloaded, 8.2 pounds with its full 20-round magazine.
Depending on numerous factors, such as topography and psychology, the
riflemen carried anywhere from 12 to 20 magazines, usually in cloth
bandoliers, adding on another 8.4 pounds at minimum, 14 pounds at
maximum. When it was available, they also carried M-16 maintenance
gear—rods and steel brushes and swabs and tubes of LSA oil—all of
which weighed about a pound. Among the grunts, some carried the M-79
grenade launcher, 5.9 pounds unloaded, a reasonably light weapon
except for the ammunition, which was heavy. A single round weighed 10
ounces. The typical load was 25 rounds. But Ted Lavender, who was
scared, carried 34 rounds when he was shot and killed outside Than Khe,
and he went down under an exceptional burden, more than 20 pounds of
ammunition, plus the flak jacket and helmet and rations and water and
toilet paper and tranquilizers and all the rest, plus the unweighed fear.
He was dead weight. There was no twitching or flopping. Kiowa, who saw
it happen, said it was like watching a rock fall, or a big sandbag or
something—just boom, then down—not like the movies where the dead
guy rolls around and does fancy spins and goes ass over teakettle—not
like that, Kiowa said, the poor bastard just flat-fuck fell. Boom. Down.
Nothing else. It was a bright morning in mid-April. Lieutenant Cross felt
the pain. He blamed himself. They stripped off Lavender's canteens and
ammo, all the heavy things, and Rat Kiley said the obvious, the guy's
dead, and Mitchell Sanders used his radio to report one U.S. KIA and to
request a chopper. Then they wrapped Lavender in his poncho. They
Christine Taylor Riendeau Thursday, February 16, 2012 11:56:25 AM ET
carried him out to a dry paddy, established security, and sat smoking the
dead man's dope until the chopper came. Lieutenant Cross kept to
himself. He pictured Martha's smooth young face, thinking he loved her
more than anything, more than his men, and now Ted Lavender was
dead because he loved her so much and could not stop thinking about
her. When the dustoff arrived, they carried Lavender aboard. Afterward
they burned Than Khe. They marched until dusk, then dug their holes,
and that night Kiowa kept explaining how you had to be there, how fast it
was, how the poor guy just dropped like so much concrete. Boom-down,
he said. Like cement.
In addition to the three standard weapons—the M-60, M-16, and M79—they carried whatever presented itself, or whatever seemed
appropriate as a means of killing or staying alive. They carried catch-ascatch-can. At various times, in various situations, they carried M-14s and
CAR-15s and Swedish Ks and grease guns and captured AK-47s and ChiComs and RPGs and Simonov carbines and black market Uzis and .38-
caliber Smith & Wesson handguns and 66 mm LAWs and shotguns and
silencers and blackjacks and bayonets and C-4 plastic explosives. Lee
Strunk carried a slingshot; a weapon of last resort, he called it. Mitchell
Sanders carried brass knuckles. Kiowa carried his grandfather's
feathered hatchet. Every third or fourth man carried a Claymore
antipersonnel mine—3.5 pounds with its firing device. They all carried
fragmentation grenades—14 ounces each. They all carried at least one M18 colored smoke grenade—24 ounces. Some carried CS or tear gas
grenades. Some carried white phosphorus grenades. They carried all they
could bear, and then some, including a silent awe for the terrible power
of the things they carried.
In the first week of April, before Lavender died, Lieutenant Jimmy
Cross received a good-luck charm from Martha. It was a simple pebble,
an ounce at most. Smooth to the touch, it was a milky white color with
flecks of orange and violet, oval-shaped, like a miniature egg. In the
accompanying letter, Martha wrote that she had found the pebble on the
Jersey shoreline, precisely where the land touched water at high tide,
where things came together but also separated. It was this separate-buttogether quality, she wrote, that had inspired her to pick up the pebble
and to carry it in her breast pocket for several days, where it seemed
Christine Taylor Riendeau Thursday, February 16, 2012 11:56:25 AM ET
weightless, and then to send it through the mail, by air, as a token of her
truest feelings for him. Lieutenant Cross found this romantic. But he
wondered what her trues
